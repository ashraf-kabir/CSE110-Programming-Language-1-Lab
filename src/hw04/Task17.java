/**
 * Task 17:
 * In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers form a sequence defined by the following recurrence relation:
 * That is, after two starting values, each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.
 * The first Fibonacci numbers, also denoted as Fn, for n = 0, 1, â€¦ , are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233,
 * Write javacode of a program, which prints all Fibonacci numbers that are less than 1600.
