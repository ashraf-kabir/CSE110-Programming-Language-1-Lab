Task 1:
Write javacode of a program that reads a student’s mark for a single subject, and prints out “Pass” if the student got more than 50, and “You shall not pass” otherwise.

Task 2:
Write javacode of a program that reads a student’s mark for a single subject, and prints out the corresponding grade for that mark. The mark ranges and corresponding grades are shown in the table below. Valid range of marks is 0 to 100. Print “Wrong Input” otherwise.
Marks            Grade
90 and above       A
80-89              B
70-79              C
60-69              D
50-59              E
Below 50           F

Task 3:
Write javacode of a program for finding area of a rectangle given height and width by the user.

Task 4:
Write javacode of a program that calculates the tax as follows:
a) No tax if you get paid less than 10,000
b) 5% tax if you get paid between 10K and 20K
c) 10% tax if you get paid more than 20K
d) NO TAX IF YOU ARE LESS THAN 18 YEARS OLD.
Hint: Take payment and age from user as inputs; then calculate tax and prints it.

Task 5:
Write javacode of a program that finds the number of hours, minutes, and seconds in a given number of seconds. For example, how many hours, minutes, and seconds are there in 10,000 seconds?

Task 6:
Suppose the following expressions are used to calculate the values of L for different values of S:
L = 3000-(125*(S^2))             if S < 100
L = 12000/4+((S^2)/14900)        if S >= 100

Write javacode of a program that reads a value of S and then calculates the value of L.

Task 7:
Write javacode of a program that reads the values for the three sides x, y, and z of a triangle, and then calculates its area. The area is calculated as follows:
area = √(s(s − x)(s − y)(s − z))
where s is (x+y+z)/2

Task 8:
A leading newspaper pays all their freelance writers at a rate of Tk. 500 per published article. Write javacode of a program that will read the number of published articles for one writer, and print the total
monthly fees for that writer.

Task 9:
Write javacode of a program to find the largest among three different numbers entered by user.

Task 10:
Write javacode for the following:
1) Ask the user to enter the name of his favorite car.
2) Display the name of the user’s favorite car 4 times.
Example: If the user enters “Toyota”, your program should print the name Toyota 4 times.

Task 11:
Write javacode for the following:
Ask user for mark, currentScale, targetScale and then convert the mark from currentScale to targetScale. If user gives 5, 10, 30, that means quiz mark 5 is out of 10 (currentScale), convert it to 30 and print 15.

Task 12:
Write javacode for the following:
Assume all first semester students have 4 courses: CSE110, ENG091, MAT110, PHY111. Credits for these courses are 3, 0, 3, 3 respectively. Take the grades of four courses from the user (out of 4.0 scale) and then print the GPA.
Formula:
GPA = summation of (multiplication of grade and credit of each course) divided by sum of credits = (grade1xcredit1 + grade2xcredit2 + grade3xcredit3 ....) / (credit1 + credit 2+credit 3 ....)
