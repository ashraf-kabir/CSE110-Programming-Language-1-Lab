Task1) Assume that we have the following array contains
marks of 5 students.
int[] marks = new int[] {10, 30, 20, 50, 40};
Find the max, min, average mark.
Output:
Highest mark is 50
Lowest mark is 10
Average mark is 30

Task2) Assume that we have the following array contains marks.
int[] marks = new int[] {10, 30, 20, 50, 40};
Find how many students are better than average.
Output:
2 students are better than average.
They received following marks
50
40

Hint: First calculate average marks. Then loop through the marks
array and count how many marks are greater than average.
Print this count. Then again, loop through the marks and count
how many elements were greater than average marks.

Task3) Assume that we have the following array.
int[] a = new int[] {10, 30, 20, 50, 40};
Find the largest number and print it along with its location.
Output:
Largest number is 50
Largest number was found at location 3


Task4) Assume that we have the following array.
int[] a = new int[] {10, 30, 20, 50, 40};

Modify Task21. Swap the first number with largest number.
Your output should be 50, 30, 20, 10, 40

Hint:
Find largestNumber and largestNumberLocation.
backup = a[0];
a[0]=largestNumber;
a[largestNumberLocation]=backup;


Task5) Assume that we have the following array.
int[] a = new int[] {50, 30, 20, 10, 40};
Modify Task22.

Find largest number among all numbers between 2nd and
last number (30, 20, 10, 40).
Swap the 2nd number with this largest number.
Thus you just put 2nd largest in 2nd position.

Task6) Combine ideas from Task 22 and 23.
Ask the user for a number n, and then find nth highest number

Hint:
Repeat the idea (from task 22,23) n times.
Then you will find nth highest number in nth position in array.

Task 7) Modify Task 24 to sort / arrange all numbers in the array.
Your output should be 50, 40, 30, 20, 10

Task 8) Find median among some numbers.
Ask user how many numbers and input those numbers.

Definition of Median:
For example, if a < b < c, then the median of the list {a, b, c} is b,
and, if a < b < c < d, then the median
 of the list {a, b, c, d} is the mean of b and c;
i.e., it is (b + c)/2.

Hint:
Sort numbers
if there are odd number of numbers, say 9, then
the median is the middle number, at 5th position

if there are even number of numbers, say 10, then
the median is average of two middle numbers, (5th+6th)/2

Sample Input 1:
5
10 50 40 20 30
Sample Output 1:
30
Sample Input 2:
6
10 50 40 20 30 60
Sample Output 2:
35
